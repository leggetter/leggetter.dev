Of [all the questions](https://github.com/leggetter/leggetter.dev/labels/question) I received this was one of the most difficult because I feel we're working through some problems. So, what I thought I'd share here is our current team members locations, team structure along with a combination of what I've seen working, some of the issues we're presently experiencing and thoughts on how we may remedy these. In doing this, I hope others will provide feedback and pointers to help us and others improve.

## Nexmo Developer Relations Team Locations & Structure

The [Developer Relations team at Nexmo](https://developer.nexmo.com/team), the Vonage API Platform is a remote-first team. We are a team of people located in San Francisco to London through to Singapore.

The team has grown from three full-time people and one part-timer person back in March 2016 to 26 full-time people in March 2019. With that, the team's responsibilities have increased as well as an expectation to do more of what we were already doing. To enable this, we've created smaller teams within Developer Relations who focus on specific areas.

* DevX - [Nexmo Developer](https://leggetter.dev) (our documentation platform) and API design
* Content - blog posts, webinars and videos
* [Extend](https://developer.nexmo.com/extend) - how you can use the Nexmo APIs with complementary technologies and platforms
* Client libraries - maintain and enhance our API libraries (server-side SDKs)
* Community - enable our internal and external community support

We also have a few product-focused initiatives that will evolve with the product life cycle. For example, Nexmo Client is in "developer preview" so a lot of time is being spent working on the experience our SDKs provide, documentation, developer tooling and code samples. When the product is more mature, the focus will shift to raising awareness of the product and further demonstrating what it makes possible.

Now that the team structure, location and focus has been shared. Here are the factors that are presently top of mind for me when building a successful remote team.

## Meet In-Person

As a remote-first team, you can fall into the trap of undervaluing team members meeting in person. We've made this mistake in the past, and it's contributed to losing some great people. So, in 2017 and 2018, when the team was of a size in the mid-teens, we had two full team all-hands (Lisbon, Portugal and New York, US). In 2019, with the team approaching thirty people we've kicked off the year with a full team all-hands (Athens, Greece) and will have likely regional all-hands mid-year (US and EMEA + APAC).

Meeting in person is easier for some than others. We have quite a few people based in the UK, and we're all only ever a few hours travel away from a colleague. For those spread across America or based on in locations where we have fewer team members, it's much harder. So more effort (and cost) is required to ensure these essential in-person meetings take place.

We're lucky enough to have a reasonably good budget for travel and spend around 10% of our time travelling (averaged across the whole team). Because of this, we've recently started encouraging people to use events as an opportunity to catch up by extending event trips by a day or two. Sometimes just working in the same space for the day is enough to ensure relationships are built and maintained.

Spending time to maintain relationships is something that I've personally seen as being important. As the team has grown, I've had less face-to-face time with those that I used to spend quite a bit of time with. The lack of face time has resulted in relationships breaking down. So, I'm spending more time in 2019 travelling to meet my colleagues in person and having video calls with all the team.

## Use a Wiki (a.k.a Write Down All Important Things)

All vital information for a team - remote or co-located - should be written down. However, co-located office workers spend a lot of time speaking to each other, and it's more like that important information will spread by word of mouth, so the need for information to be captured and shared in digital form is often forgotten.

As a remote team, we spend a lot of time communicating in Slack, so most communications are written down. However, "chatty" content is frequently skipped by a reader, and key information easily missed by others. When an interesting or important topic of conversation takes place, discussed, actions suggested, or conclusions made that information should be captured and summarised in a wiki. Should it be a topic of discussion for a future call? If so, make it an agenda item. If a conclusion is reached ensure it's added to the appropriate place in your team wiki or to whatever task solution your team uses e.g. Jira or Trello.

Our meetings generally take place via video. We try to ensure that each meeting has a clear agenda beforehand and that those participating have the chance to read, comment or add items. Meeting minutes are captured along with any assigned actions. This is good practice no matter the team working environment. We also try to record all meetings.

Since we also encourage meeting up in person, it's essential that these practices are followed for in-person meetings.

## Use Voice & Video Calls More Often

Our team spends a lot of time in Slack. It's a fantastic tool for remote workers but also co-located teams that want to quickly communicate without the need for the time it takes to have in-person meetings.

However, as a team that relies so heavily on text-based communication, that form of communication becomes the default for all communications when a voice or video call would be more effective. When co-located those moments happen naturally. When a team is so used to communicating using text, those "quick chat" moments take place far too often.

My recommendation is that remote teams should take advantage of voice and video calls more often.

I'd also recommend that the default for such calls should be to enable video. Being able to see the person you are communicating with, see and interpret facial movement and body language, and react accordingly, adds a beneficial depth to a conversation.

## Transparent and Timely Communication

Transparent communication is something that every business and team with tout as essential when fostering a great culture. Since forming the larger Nexmo Developer Relations team in March 2016 the vast majority of decisions have been made as a group, communication has been open, and news from across the company instantly shared with everyone in the team.

Based on what I have to admit is a limited experience of just three years, growing from a team of 4 in a company of 150 to a team of 26 in a company of 2,400, being instantly transparent works with smaller teams or in smaller companies. The amount of information to share and the number of decisions to be made at a smaller scale are manageable.  If you continue to instantly share information and ask for full team opinion on every decision to be made in a larger team and company, far too much time is spent discussing and thinking and not enough time is spent executing.

In a larger team, information has to be digested and distributed at an appropriate time, and feedback sought when ideas have more clearly formed and set of options ready for a focused discussion. A key enabler for this is that there is trust in the individuals receiving the unfiltered information that form proposals, ready for additional input and feedback.

All of this is, of course, relevant to co-located teams. However, I've found the problems to be exacerbated within a remote team because it's easier to work through more difficult conversations in-person.

## Flexibility

A big reason for remote working is to fit a job around your life. However, there's no point in allowing remote work if there's an expectation of being at a desk during fixed hours.

It is important that people are reachable during normal working hours so they can reply to questions or requests in a timely manner. But where and when people do their more focused work should be up to them as long as it's effective for the rest of the team.

## General Team Building

The rest is down to team building strategy and tactics that should work anywhere, whether remote or co-located. Here are some important ones from my perspective.

* Don't dictate, collaborate. Lesson: at some point you share for collaboration later in the process.
* Learn together. We're all learning and we need to be honest about that.
