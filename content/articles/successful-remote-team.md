Of [all the questions](https://github.com/leggetter/leggetter.dev/labels/question) I received this was one of the most difficult because I feel we're working through some problems. So, what I thought I'd share here is our current team structure along with a combination of what I've seen working and some of the issues we're presently experiencing along with thoughts on how we may remedy these. In doing this, I hope others will provide feedback and pointers to help us and others improve.

## Team Structure

The [Developer Relations team at Nexmo](https://developer.nexmo.com/team), the Vonage API Platform is a remote-first team. We are a team of people located in San Francisco to London through to Singapore.

The team has grown from three full-time people and one part-timer person back in March 2016 to 26 full-time people in March 2019. With that, the team's responsibilities have increased as well as an expectation to do more of what we were already doing. To enable this, we've created smaller teams within Developer Relations who focus on specific areas.

* DevX - [Nexmo Developer](https://leggetter.dev) (our documentation platform) and API design
* Content - blog posts, webinars and videos
* [Extend](https://developer.nexmo.com/extend) - how you can use the Nexmo APIs with complementary technologies and platforms
* Client libraries - maintain and enhance our API libraries (server-side SDKs)
* Community - enable our internal and external community support

## Meeting In-Person

* Taking advantage of events
* All-hands year kickoff
* Half year regional meets
* Encourage face-to-face meets

## Communication Strategy

* Open
* Digital
* Same experience for everyone

## Communication Tactics

* Use of video
* Communications tools
* Small focused teams

## Flexibility

A big reason for remote working is to fit a job around your life. However, there's no point in allowing remote work if there's an expectation of being at a desk during fixed hours.

## The Rest

The rest is down to team building strategy and tactics that should work anywhere, whether remote or co-located. Here are some important ones from my perspective.

* Don't dictate, collaborate. Lession: at some point you share for collaboration later in the process.
* Learn together. We're all learning and we need to be honest about that.
