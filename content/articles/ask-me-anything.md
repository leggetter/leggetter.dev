In search of inspiration on Tuesday 5th of March 2019 I wrote a tweet asking for ideas for content.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;d like to do a bit of writing this week and need inspiration. <br><br>Do you have any questions about developer relations and experience? Or about team building? Or any other subject you think I may be able to share some thoughts on?<br><br>If so, I&#39;d love to hear them.<br><br>ðŸ“®</p>&mdash; Phil Leggetter (@leggetter) <a href="https://twitter.com/leggetter/status/1102860643642822657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Although the tweet doesn't say "Ask Me Anything" I'm certainly open to being asked anything about the work I've done so far or my thoughts on where the Developer Relations and Developer Experience profession will go from here.

The articles that follow this one - for the time being - will be inspired by thoughts and questions that follow this request for inspiration.

If you'd like to ask a question you can get in touch in the following ways:
