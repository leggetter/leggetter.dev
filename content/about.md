In a search for inspiration on Tuesday 5th of March 2019 I wrote a tweet asking for ideas for content.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;d like to do a bit of writing this week and need inspiration. <br><br>Do you have any questions about developer relations and experience? Or about team building? Or any other subject you think I may be able to share some thoughts on?<br><br>If so, I&#39;d love to hear them.<br><br>ðŸ“®</p>&mdash; Phil Leggetter (@leggetter) <a href="https://twitter.com/leggetter/status/1102860643642822657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The articles here are inspired by thoughts and questions that followed.
